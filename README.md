## üìñ About the project
This project is part of the Mobile Device Programming (PDM) course in the 4th semester at IFTM. Therefore, this project serves as the 2nd evaluative activity (exam) for PDM. <br>
The project idea is to perform basic property rentals through a mobile application. The app has multiple screens to facilitate user interaction. Additionally, as stated in the exam instructions, we are required to create three classes: Proprietario (Owner), Imoveis (Properties), and Inquilino (Tenant).
